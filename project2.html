<h1>Story</h1>
<p1>
Starts off as a mountie in a forest. Walking his dog. Mountie walks forward and finds giant moose. Mountie attacks moose and the moose eats his dog. Wakes up in a wizard’s hut. Wizard calls you stupid for attacking moose. Wizard gives you a small knife. You leave wizards house and walk to a fork in a path. He walks right and finds a beaver, he pets the beaver, and the beaver joins his party. He goes back and walks left and finds a cabin. Walks up to cabin but it is locked. He pets his beaver and his beaver coughs up a key. Key opens door. Walk inside and there is a small chicken with ten feet sitting in the center of the room. The mountie and the beaver fights the chicken and wins. The chicken says “You have defeated me, if you continue north of here and find my brother cluckers he will tell you where to find the sword.” The chicken explodes. You walk past the house and you find a small town with many people standing around talking. The mountie calls out for cluckers. To your left you hear someone say “I’m cluckers” He walks to his left and finds a chicken in a top hat and a monocle. Talks to the chicken and the chicken gets mad that you killed his brother. The mountie defeats the chicken and the chicken says “Alright, Justin Trudeau will know where the sword is” The mountie looks around and sees a train that has stops at Niagara Falls, Vancouver, Justin Trudeau’s house, and Ottawa. He buys a ticket to Justin Trudeau’s house. He gets on the train and finds a spell tome for mind reading under the seat. The train stops and he gets out in Justin Trudeau’s living room. He uses the spell on Justin Trudeau and figures out that the magical moose killing sword is back in the wizard's hut. He goes back to the wizard's hut and asks the wizard where the sword is. The mountie attacks the wizard and after he defeats the wizard the wizard drops a magical speaking sword. The sword says exit the hut. The sword says to walk west. The sword says to walk south. The mountie sees a giant moose in the distance and decides to attack it. He cuts the moose open with the magical sword and inside finds his dog.

<p1>First I am showing you how to play the game, it gives you options of what to say, but at certain points in the game you can go off script and win the game early by petting the giant moose, or petting the smart beaver. If you continued with the real story it would have brought you to Justin Trudeaus house where you get MOOSECALIBER the legendary blade of Canada and you could have defeated the moose and saved your dog, but it takes more than 1 minute to beat the game that way. Then after I show how the game works I englarge the code so you can see how I did it.</p1>

   First in the development process was writing the story for the game, we went through step by step and created a story we thought would be suited for a text based adventure. We then went to creately and created a flow chart mapping out the possible decisions for the text based adventure to go through. After this we started coding and actually turning the story and the flowchart into the finished product. One difficulty we had with this was we couldn’t figure out how to clear the screen for the end game. We wanted it to say, “THE END” at the end of the game on its own screen. I ended up figuring out a solution by putting print with no text following it, so it looks as if the screen is being cleared. Another difficulty we encountered was when we tried to spell out “THE END” in big letters. We wanted to spell it out by making the big letters on different lines with multiple print commands and shaping the letters out with /’s but this didn’t work because when you use a slash inside quotation marks it doesn’t show up, so we ended up using the straight symbol “|”. One part of the program I completed independently was the coding and the debugging.
